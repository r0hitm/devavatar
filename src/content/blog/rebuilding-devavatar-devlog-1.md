In the [last blog post](/posts/rebuilding-dev-avatar), I mentioned my decision to rebuild Dev Avatar. To give a quick recap: 1) I wanted to separate the content from the website code, and 2) revisit some design decisions, especially the ones tied to the starter template I used previously.

## This Week

By "this week," I mean last week... since this post is a little late, haha. But letâ€™s talk about the progress I made in that time. Here's a rough plan I came up with for the redesign:

1. Brainstorm features: What pages should the rebuild have? What types of posts, UI elements, etc.?
2. Decide on the new color schemes and anime-inspired aesthetics.
3. Draft a design based on those ideas.
4. Set up a separate CMS repo using TinaCMS.
5. Start coding the website.

### On Brainstorming

This time around, Iâ€™m treating this as a proper personal blog, which I was hesitant to do before.

- **Mobile-first design:** No collapsible header for navs; keep it simple and straightforward.
- **Pages:** Home, all posts, topics (plus per-topic pages), about.
- **Tagging:** "One post, one ~~tag~~ topic"â€” and, removing the search bar for now.
- **Post Topics:** this will replace multi-tag setup that I currently use.
    - **Programming:** For CS & theory, tutorials, etc.
    - **Devlog:** For Project updates, etc.
    - **Web Development:** (Still debating the name and function...)
    - **æ—¥æœ¬èªž (Japanese):** TBD
    - **Opinions:** TBD
    - **Misc:** TBD
- **No pagination** on the /posts/ page.
- **Social Links:** Fewer of them.
- **Sitemap Improvements:** Adding last modified date, priority settings, etc.
- **Localization:** Thinking about supporting both English and Japanese, but not sure if Iâ€™ll localize the entire site or just some sections. TBD

### On Design

I already had the new dark and light color schemes prepared, so that didnâ€™t take much time. Here's the palette:

But finding the right anime aesthetic was tricky. I toyed around with Avatar, Zelda, and computer-themed anime styles, even tried generating some ideas with AI, but Iâ€™m still undecided.

### About TinaCMS...

I decided to tackle step 4 (setting up the CMS) before step 3 (design), but things didnâ€™t go as planned. I followed the official TinaCMS and Astro integration docs, double-checked everything, but I kept running into this error from `tinacms` on build, but the `main` branch DOES EXIST on the Tina Cloud, and I've pushed all the changes from both the repos!

```sh
ERROR: Branch 'main' is not on Tina Cloud. Please make sure that branch 'main' exists in your repository and that you have pushed all changes to the remote.
```

Iâ€™m rebuilding my blog site with a separate content repo, and while everything works in local dev mode - well, I don't count this because this uses the local filesystem of the website repo and not the content repo. It might be outdated docs or just a bug (TinaCMS).

I even tried their recommended starter template with Next.js and Tina preconfigured. It worked... sort of. The default blog post didnâ€™t publish properlyâ€” instead, the processed AST showed up on the page ðŸ˜±. Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s a bug! I reached out on their Discord yesterday, but no response yet.

So yeah, Iâ€™m kind of stuck with a simple Astro website. My options now are:

1. Stick with Astroâ€™s content collection (which Iâ€™m already using).
2. Set up TinaCMS on the same repo (but after the Next.js fail, Iâ€™m skeptical).
3. _Not rewrite at all?_ ðŸ¤” I mean, thatâ€™s a fair point, but I really need a better system for publishing posts.

## Plans for Next Week

I havenâ€™t decided yet which option Iâ€™ll go with. Since the whole point of the rewrite was to decouple the content, if I donâ€™t hear back from TinaCMS by Wednesday, Iâ€™ll probably start looking into other CMS options. Letâ€™s see how it goes.
