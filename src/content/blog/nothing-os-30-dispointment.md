This post is a direct response to the recent update of Nothing OS 3.0 on my Nothing Phone (2a) Plus. I have been using the phone for a while now (See my one month review [here](/posts/nothing-2a-plus-personal-review-after-one-month)), and mostly I have been very happy with it. But the recent update has left me disappointed and salty. Very saltyðŸ§‚.

## The Long Wait and Underwhelming Results

I waited for months for this update. Initially, it was promised for December 2024, but then the timeline was pushed to early 2025. The delay built up anticipation, but the results did not justify the wait.

### Key Issues:

- **Adaptive Color Palettes Are Broken:** The quick settings completely ignore wallpaper colors, defeating the purpose of Android's adaptive theming.
- **Missing Icon Pack Colors:** The color-based monochrome icon pack is straight-up missing from the settings after the update. It only has default, nothing's black/white, and a empty space where the color-based icon pack used to be.
- **Animation Glitches:** There are noticeable glitches in the quick settings pull-down, especially when interacting with the media player - particularly during the transition from the notification shade to the quick settings, media player is not in sync w/ the animation.
- **No Swiggly Seek Bar:** I always disliked that the media player on Nothing lacks the squiggly seek bar found on stock Android. Unfortunately, this update did nothing to address that.

## Community Reactions: Cult-Like Defensiveness?

The Nothing Phone community, especially on Discord, seems overly defensive, dismissing valid concerns about the update. Even a friend who influenced my decision to buy this phone has defended the changes, downplaying the issues I raised and suggesting Iâ€™m just looking for things to complain about, which feels frustrating.

For example, they justify the removal of the adaptive color palette by claiming:

> Nothing has specifically chosen not to implement such colors to make the phone less distracting for serious work.

I find this reasoning weak. Making the phone "less distracting" feels more like an excuse than a legitimate design philosophy. If distraction-free design is the goal, why not offer options to users rather than enforcing a particular aesthetic?

> People choose different aesthetics for a reason. Nothing offers something that people here clearly like and want to support. I'm not saying asking for change is wrong, but you should choose a device that fits your needs and aesthetics better, not choose a specific device and try to change everything about it.

When I bought the phone, it was on version 2.6, and it was great. This update, especially after such a long wait, feels like a bait-and-switch tactic. Itâ€™s similar to a shady subscription service that changes its terms after you sign up.

Iâ€™m not asking for drastic changes. I appreciate many aspects of Nothingâ€™s design language, but removing features, introducing glitches, and then labeling it all as "distraction-free" feels like an excuse rather than progress.

## Beta-Like Experience

The update feels incompleteâ€”almost like a beta version. The number of animation glitches, especially in quick settings, makes it hard to ignore the lack of polish.

> As the consumer, you have the power. If you donâ€™t like something about the OS, have feedback or suggestions, then absolutely voice themâ€”or vote with your wallet. Itâ€™s difficult because thereâ€™s also a lot of people that love the new direction.

I understand this sentiment, and I have sent feedback through the settings app. I can only hope they listen.

## Final Thoughts

Iâ€™m not in the "Nothing hater" camp, but I canâ€™t ignore these flaws. I appreciate the improved unlocking speed, responsiveness, battery life, and a more usable quick settings panel. However, the glitches, missing features, and overly defensive community are frustrating.

Iâ€™m tired and will end my rant here, hoping that Nothing listens to its users and fixes these issues. If these updates truly aim to be _distraction-free_, then Iâ€™m not sure what to say other than: **Iâ€™m disappointed**.
