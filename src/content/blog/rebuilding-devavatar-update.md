This blog post is long overdue because I got caught up in other things. This post follows from the [last devlog post](/posts/rebuilding-devavatar-devlog-1). Essentially, TinaCMS didn't work for my use case due to bugs and unexpected behavior. I asked for help on their Discord server, and one of the maintainers said I had to do some extra stuff to make a separate content repo work (I don't remember exactly, since it was last month), but it didn't work. Then they asked me to send my website code so they could look into it and reproduce the issue. I never heard back from them.

Around the same time, I stopped using Obsidian for writing my blog posts because of its line ending issues on Windows for this use case. Instead, I'm now using my text editor and dev server. This is somewhat better since the assets load on the dev server, but they didn't in Obsidian due to my path aliases.

For what it's worth, I'm pausing the rebuild for the moment because Google has also been giving me good indexing reports now, especially after I fixed my sitemap configs.

I might go back to redo the color scheme or extend the types of blogs I write on this version, but for now, I've realized that I don't want to do a complete overhaul if most of it works. "If it ain't broken, don't fix it."
