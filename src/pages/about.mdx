Hi! I'm Rohit, and I love creating things that make life easier and more fun. When I'm not coding, you'll find me deep into anime, exploring the latest Legend of Zelda adventure, vibing to music, or dabbling in something cute and creative. Also a huge fan of Japanese culture.

I speak Hindi, English, and conversational Japanese — 今年、絶対に日本語能力が上がるように頑張ります。I am planning to write some articles in Japanese (i11n) soon, so stay tuned!

On the technical side, I studied Electronics at the University of Delhi and worked on my niche interests through [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and, finished [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) some time ago. Now, I am part of the moderation team at the official OSSU discord community, helping facilitate the peer-learning experience, and maintain the quality of the community.

Currently, working as Lead Front-End developer at a Netherlands-based startup - we're building something cool on the Cardano blockchain. If you're interested in my work or projects, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/r0hitm) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r0hitm) profiles.

I'm always up for interesting conversations, collaborations, or just chatting about anime! Find me through the links below or drop me a line at `rohitm09 [at] proton [dot] me`.
