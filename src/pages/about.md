Hi there! Hello! I'm Rohit. I love creating things that make life easier and more fun via computers, and I'm a huge fan of Japanese culture. Outside of development, I enjoy anime, reading, gaming (especially titles like The Legend of Zelda and Sekiro!), music, and hitting the gym.

I speak Hindi, English, and Japanese. I passed the JLPT N3 last year and am aiming for the N1 this year. I'm considering adding Japanese localization to my site soon, so stay tuned!

On the technical side, I graduated from the University of Delhi with a BSc (Hons) in Electronics. I've pursued my interests through [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and recently finished [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I was also a moderator for the official OSSU Discord community for over two years. I'm about to finish Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms specialization. Afterwards, I'm torn between grinding LeetCode or diving into _"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces"_. I haven't decided yet, so if you have an opinion, please do reach out!

Currently, I'm working full-time as a remote Lead Front-End Developer for a startup based in the Netherlands. I'm in the process of adding my projects to this website (the rebuild of DevAvatar is still a work in progressâ€”stay tuned!). For more details, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/r0hitm) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/r0hitm).

I'm always open to interesting conversations, collaborations, or just a general chat! Feel free to contact me via email or join the Discord server, both of which are linked in the footer.
