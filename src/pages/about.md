Hi there! Hello! I'm Rohit, aka Moe Programmer. I love using computers to create things that make life easier, more fun, or just plain wacky xD. I'm also a huge fan of Japanese culture. Outside of development, I enjoy anime, reading, gaming (especially titles like The Legend of Zelda and Sekiro!), music, and hitting the gym.

I speak Hindi, English, and Japanese. I passed the JLPT N3 last year and I will take N1 this year (yeah, I'm skipping N2, just like I skipped N4 and N5â€”exams are easy, communication is hard, that's me xD). I'm considering adding Japanese localization to my site soon, so stay tuned!

On the technical side, I graduated from the University of Delhi with a BSc (Hons) in Electronics, focusing on electronic devices, digital electronics, and low-level programming. I also pursued my interests through [OSSU's Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and finished [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) a while back. I was a moderator for the official OSSU Discord community for over three years.

Currently, I'm working full-time as a remote Principal Software Engineer for a startup based in the Netherlands. For more, feel free to check out my socials in the site footer below.

**P.S.**: I'll be waiting for your messageâ€”or even better, join the Discord server!
