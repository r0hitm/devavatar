Hi, I'm Rohit.

I like using computers to make small tools, websites, and random experiments that either make my life easier or are just fun to play with. That curiosity really kicked off back in middle school after watching Iron Man and wondering how close real-world tech could get to that.

I'm also really into Japanese culture. When I'm not coding, I'm probably watching anime, reading, gaming, listening to music, or at the gym pretending training to be the next shounen protagonist.

I speak Hindi, English, and Japanese. I'm slowly working on adding a Japanese version of this site, so if you ever see half-broken JP text here, that's probably me experimenting.

### A bit about my background

I studied Electronics at the University of Delhi, where I spent a lot of time with digital circuits, electronic devices, and low-level programming. Around the same time, I fell down the computer science rabbit hole through open curricula like OSSU and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), plus more online courses than I can reasonably list.

Online communities have been a big part of how I learned. I helped moderate the official OSSU Discord for over three years, and from that community grew [The Borr Project](https://borrproject.github.io/), a community fork of OSSU that I now co‑run with friends I met there.

For more than a year, I worked as the lead developer at a small startup based in the Netherlands. The company eventually closed after the sudden passing of the founder, but building things from scratch with a tiny team shaped a lot of how I think about software and collaboration.

### What I like to work with

On the web side, I enjoy working with TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Astro, and Svelte. When I want to get closer to the metal or write backend logic, I usually reach for C, Python, and FastAPI, and I still enjoy poking at low-level and embedded stuff with C or assembly.

Most days you'll find me living inside Vim, tweaking my setup and shaving a little friction off whatever I'm working on.

If any of this sounds familiar or you're building something interesting, feel free to say hi.
